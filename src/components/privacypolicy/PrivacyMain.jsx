                The Divyang Para Sports Association of Delhi (DPSA) is all about
                helping people in India who face physical challenges to play
                sports. They make sure that even those with visual impairments
                can be part of the sports community. DPSA is happy to work with
                big organizations like the International Paralympic Committee
                (IPC) in Germany and the International Amputee Sports Federation
                (IWAS) in the UK.
              </p>
              <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
                DPSA also acts as the National Paralympic Committee (NPC), which
                means they are important for Paralympic sports in India. The
                government, through the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports
                (MYAS), recognizes DPSA as a National Sports Federation (NSF).
                This means the government sees DPSA as a significant group in
                the country that helps sports grow.
              </p>
              <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
                Legally, DPSA is registered under the Societies Registration Act
                of 1860, which means they follow certain rules and guidelines.
                They operate from Delhi, which is where their main base is. DPSA
                connects India to the International Paralympic Community (IPC),
                is recognized by the government, and works to make sure
                everyone, even those with physical challenges, can enjoy and
                participate in sports.
